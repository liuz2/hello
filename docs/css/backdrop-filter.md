# backdrop-filter

The `backdrop-filter` CSS property lets you apply graphical effects such as blurring or color shifting to the area behind an element. Because it applies to everything behind the element, to see the effect you must make the element or its background at least partially transparent.

```css
backdrop-filter: none;

backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
```

Let's look at a simple [demo](../../demo/css/backdrop-filter-demo.html).
