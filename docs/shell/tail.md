# tail

The `tail` utility displays the contents of file or, by default, its standard input, to the standard output.

The options are as follows:

`-f`: The `-f` option causes tail to not stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input. The `-f` is ignored if the standard input is a pipe, but not if it is a FIFO.
