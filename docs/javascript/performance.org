#+TITLE: Performance

* Why does speed matter?

When consumers weigh the experience on your site, they aren't just comparing you with your competitors, they're rating you against the best-in-class services they use every day.

- Performance is about retaining users
- Performance is about improving conversions
- Performance is about user experience

* Measure performance with the RAIL model

** What is RAIL?

RAIL is a user-centric performance model that provides a structure for thinking about performance.

RAIL stands for four distinct aspects of web app life cycle:

1. Response
2. Animation
3. Idle
4. Load

Users have different performance expectations for each of these contexts.

- 0-16ms, smooth animation
- 0-100ms, immediate response to user action
- 100-1000ms, a natural and continuous progression of tasks
- 1000ms or more, lose focus
- 10000ms or more, frustrated and abandon tasks

** Goals and guidelines
